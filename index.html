            <p>My Capstone Project seeks to understand the question of: What do teachers think about race? and What do they think they’re supposed to think? So often we hear about schools, teachers, and administrators engaging in “Diversity Trainings” and culturally competent professional development seminars, but how does this really manifest in the classroom? I was curious to find out. With a little bit of persuasiveness and a lot of Midwestern kindness, I was able to get a sample of 9 teachers from an elementary school in Grand Rapids, Michigan. For the privacy of the respondents and the school district I won’t be using any real names. </p>
            <p>There are about 400 students that attend the school. It is 74% White, 8.5% Asian, 8% African American, 4% Hispanic, .3% American Indian (1 student), and 4.8% two or more races. 14% of students are low-income. The teaching staff is almost 100% White Females, with the exception of the principal - a Pacific Islander Male. </p>
            <p>I asked the participants, through an emailed interview, a series of questions to get them thinking about their positions as teachers, their own identities, and the identities of their students. I wanted to get an understanding of how they self-identify and how their background experiences did or did not affect their teaching. Additionally, I crafted questions that attempted to provide insight into how these teachers took on the issue of difference, with the overarching notion of race in mind. I devised these questions through reflection on my own learning during my time as an Educational Studies major. Behavior, discipline, literature, and “cultural competency” stuck out as major discrepancies in school settings when it came to the treatment of students of Color versus White students, and I sought to create a picture of the way real-life education professionals are making an impact. </p>
            <p>I chose to present my findings in a visualization for a few reasons: it is accessible through a URL to anyone and allows the user to make their own observations about the data through interaction. I am, by no means, a Computer Science major. So, I have my smart and amazing sidekick, Joe Campbell, to credit for the hours of coding that took place to create my visualization. I am also incredibly grateful to my mom for rounding up her colleagues and always being so supportive of my endeavors in Education. </p>
            <p>Without further ado, let’s begin!!</p>
