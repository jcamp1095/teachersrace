Teacher1,45,Male,White,Public,Third Grade Teacher,None,"The Invention of Hugo Cabret by Brian Selznick (White Male), Swindle by Gordon Korman (White Male), Belly Up by Stuart Gibbs (White Male), because all of these novels are about solving their own problems without help of adults. It's empowering.",100% White staff except for Principal who is Filipino. I am the only General Ed Male Teacher. Majority White (80%ish) at one time I think there were 14 different languages spoken at our school. We are a Title I school. ,"I think it probably does to some degree. I grew up in the same school district, but was not as well off as a lot of our students are now. The lessons and curriculum are dictated by our administration. I have been trained as a member of our Global Learning Team. I love the diversity of our school and encourage each of my students to be proud of who they are.","I believe well behaved students are respectful of others. They follow the rules and are hardworking and honest. I tell them they are all going to make mistakes, but its what they do after that, that matters. Honesty is HUGE with me. ",A misbehaving student is someone not following the rules or being disrespectful in some way. When it happens I believe it is due to a lack of understanding the context- it could be a way to get the attention off of the real issue.,"I use restorative practices, which I am also trained in. I wish they would train more of the staff members. Restorative Questions include: What happened? What were you thinking at the time? What have you thought about since? Who has been affected by what you have done? What do you think you need to do to make it right?","My students sit in groups of 8 or 9 at their own desk. Some face the front, back, or side. It works because I move around the room a lot and teach from all over. We switch seats every 2 weeks. I have 2 couches in the back where we go every morning as a community. I have a class library with a ton of books for them to choose from. My room is organized. I don't like a mess. The walls are covered with student work, inspirational posters, and my school flags. ",Being understanding of cultures other than my own.,I have a high level of compassion for my students. So caring for them and being sensitive of their cultural differences comes naturally. I have also been trained in GLI.

I also allow students on counters or under if a lesson allows. On the walls is kid art, maps, cultural posters.",Being able to understand that home cultures can lead to different reactions to the same situation and being willing to try different approaches.,Moderate competency due to my EL background and trainings. I have short 30-60 minute interactions so hard to say if I could do more. 
Teacher3,56,Female,White,Public Suburban,Fourth Grade Teacher,Second Grade Teacher,"Rump: The True Story of Rumpelstiltskin by Liesl Shurtliff (White Female)- it’s a funny twisted fairytale. The Wild Robot by Peter Brown (White Male)- very unique book about robot that teaches acceptance. Wonder by R.J. Palacio (Brown Female)-great book about accepting others, love Mr. Browne's precepts.","Mostly female. Three males including Principal. Staff predominately White. Students are of mixed races- White, Black, Indian, and many more.","I try very hard to make sure this doesn't happen, but I'm sure it sneaks in once in a while.",Kind to others and respectful of people and property.,"Mean or unkind to others and disrespectful to other students, staff, or school property.",Talk to student privately. Classroom behavior plan then involving parents and school principal if this doesn't work.  I am happy with how our school handles discipline.,"My classroom is rectangular. It has a sink and drinking fountain and two bathrooms. My students are arranged in groups of 4 to 5 students - usually 2 boys and 2 girls. Students are partnered with  elbow partners, who they do most of their work with. These elbow partners are same-sex pairs of similar academic level. I have a smart projector, and all my students have their own chromebook to use at school. We also have our own 3D printer. On the walls you will find a calendar, maps, and many academic aides for studentwork. This changes based on what we are studying.","Being knowledgable and sensitive to the different cultures represented in my classroom.and school.","Yes, we have had a lot of training in this in our school district for many years."
Teacher4,44,Female,White,Public,Second Grade Teacher,Kindergarten and First Grade Teacher,"Thank you Mr. Falker by Patricia Polacco (White Female)- it shows how some kids struggle and it takes the power of someone to notice and help. Obstacles can be overcome. Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day by Judith Viorst (White Female)- everyone has a bad day and they will get better. First Day Jitters by Julie Dannenberg (White Female)-read on first day so they know I'm just as nervous and scared on the 1st day.","Students are 90% white, 10% other. Faculty are 98% White and 2% minority.","It probably does in a way, but not so much that I feel that it is apparent.",Usually less behavior problems when there are set expectations and consequences.,"Misbehavior is not following the rules, not listening or being respectful of other people or property. If you give them an inch they take a foot. If you let things go a bit, like talking, things start to increase.","Power of words, love and logic.","The desks are in small groups of 4 or 5 which is nice for group or partnerwork. I have a library set up in the back, a meeting area on the floor and extra tables. Learning charts, posters,  and student work is on the walls.  Anchors, turtles, and nautical flags decorate the walls as well.",To be open and respectful to differences among cultures.,"I have learned over the years. I am the grade level EL classroom, so I have experience with children from all different backgrounds and cultures. "
MusicTeacher5,60,Female,White,Public,Music Teacher,"Private School K-9 General Music, Band, Choir, Private and Public Colleges/University","Brown Bear, Brown Bear What Do You Hear by Bill Martin Jr. (White Male)- great to add instruments to substitute for the animal sounds. Clap Your Hands by Lorinda Bryan Cauley (White Female)- because of movement activities you can use to accompany the books. Carnival of the Animals by Jack Prelutsky (White Male)- because of its relevance to the composition by the same name.",no response,"I'm sure it formulates what I first look at. Being at a more diversified school in terms of racial and socioeconomic backgrounds I seek for ways to reach all students especially through language used and by creating inclusive experiences. In terms of interaction, I seek to treat everyone the same regardless of race or wealth. ",Student behavior is a choice each student has. I cannot force them to behave. To behave means to allow the other students in the class the ability to learn by allowing the material to be presented without talking or creating distractions to the classroom learning process.,Misbehavior can happen 1-when I allow too much time between activities and 2- when a student feels a need to follow his own agenda. To misbehave is the opposite of the previous question.,"Verbal reminder then name on board, then individual private chat with student about behavior, then alerting the classroom teacher.","Students move a lot during our lessons, we never stay in one place during our 30 minute sessions. Students come sit on the floor in front of the whiteboard if they need to see something written and there are ndividual chairs in rows. Because of 420 students, no individual papers are hung on walls unless gifts drawn by students for me. On walls are the 6 elements of music followed by verbal and visual explanantions and examples, discipline reminders, hand sign charts, person of the day, and motivational sayings are scattered around the room.",I'm sure it is an education term. I would hope it would mean the ability of each student to put themselves in the shoes of someone from a different culture. This would mean the awareness of differences and similarities between them and others.,It is not my specific job to teach it. I do introduce songs and customs from different cultures. My limited time with students presents me from expanding very much in this area.

Gooseberry Park- strong lovable characters. The Raft- Shows the love of being outdoors and appreciating nature.,"""(copy another Collins paper)"" At one point I know we had 66 different countries represented in our school.","Not that I'm aware of- I do however try to incorporate many read-alouds/lessons as well sas ""History of the day"" to celebrate our differences- often inviting families in to share customs.","A student with a positive attitude toward learning & who perseveres without balking is usually ""well-behaved"". A ""Rule Follower"" without tattle-tales",1. Hurts someone else without actions or words. Purposely not following class or school rules. 2. In the classroom misbehaviors are usually the struggling students who need the most help.,I have been loving our restorative practices- just getting to know each other and every individual in my class and letting them have a voice everyday. It takes time but I feel it is a great way to prevent misbehaviors.,drawing,"Having compassion for everyone and taking action to understand other people's cultural differences and celebrating them through books, videols, projects, and forming those relationships through families.","I would hope so!

Teacher8,56,Female,White,Public Suburban,Second Grade Teacher,None,"The VanGogh Cafe by Cynthia Rylant (White Female)- I love to read this book to my students because the premise is somewhat unusual, as are the characters and the setting. Honey I Love by Eloise Greenfield (Black Woman)- This small book, written in 1986, includes poems about the joys of love and life, through the eyes of a young black girl. The Lamp, the Ice, and the Boat Called Fish by Jacqueline Briggs Martin (White Female)- this book is fascinating and based on a true story. My students absolutely love it!","Most of our staff members are white although our principal was born in the Philippines, and spoke no English when his family came to the United States. Our student population is about 80% white. We have students and families that have come from around the world and speak many languages. We are considered a Title I school because of the need, for free and reduced lunches. We have many mixed race families (one fourth of the students in my classroom), and, I also have a student with two moms.","I honestly believe that my racial identity and my socioeconomic background do influence some facets of my lesson plans. I grew up in a lower middle class neighborhood and we had a one-income household. I saw the haves and knew that I was not like them. The design and structure of my units-of-study are curriculum driven by the district. I have been extensively trained as a member of our cultural diversity team. I feel that the most important thing I can do for my students is to have available, books that represent all of us.",I feel that as long as my students respect themselves and each other they are doing a good job. I struggle when my students are dishonest but I let them know that things will be okay as long as they learn that telling the truth is a wonderful thing.,"The only time I truly feel that my students are misbehaving is when one student is hurtful or disrespectful to another student. When this does happen, we stop and take the time to discuss it. Typically, if the kids are engaged in their work and I am also excited and interested, things go smoothly.","My primary disciplinary strategy is taking the time to have my students talk about what happened and how they felt about it and what they might possibly be able to do when in a similar situation the next time. I also believe that by keeping our schedule and our expectations consistent, the kids feel safe and happy, and that is when true learning and great things can happen. I also introduce my students to our reading for pleasure system on the first day of school. When the kids come into the classroom each morning, they know that they need to select a book, and then read for 30 minutes. This is when they read for pleasure, which is separate from our reading workshop. They also read for a few moments whenever time permits, or when in transition. Something about this set-up really helps with classroom management.","My students each have a desk and they sit in small pods, or groups, facing each other. This is conducive for conferencing because when I do confer with one student, the others in that group naturally eavesdrop. We change seats about every two weeks and sometimes the kids have input as far as their new spots go. One of our focal points is a giant border in our reading and writing workshop area that is made entirely from book dust covers. I try to include book jackets that represent different ages, ethnicities, gender etc. I like to have an organized classroom because I think a lot of clutter can create an atmosphere of chaos and I have kids with severe anxiety. We do however, like to hang writing and artwork on our walls and sometimes windows. I also hang student work on tack strip in the hallway and I make sure that I hang it on the lower strip so they can stop and admire their work.","If I can consciously try to imagine being in someone else's shoes, especially when things might not be going so smoothly, I am at least working toward being culturally competent.","I think that my progressive upbringing coupled with the many hours spent working on diversity issues, have given me a leg up so to speak. I know that although I might not be able to understand completely, what people go through on a daily basis, I am at least able to consider their circumstances, and can reprogram my thinking when necessary."

I'm Conservative but would never try to influence the students one way or another.

I want the students to love to come to the media center.",Your knowledge of other cultures.,I would not say high. I know more about some than others. I do try to embrace all cultures. I love to learn about other cultures than my own and share that knowledge with students
